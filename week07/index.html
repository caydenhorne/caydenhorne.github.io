<p style="font-family: Sans-serif"> <p style="background-color: rgb(239,25,25)"> I am going to discuss the issue of Human Trafficking in our society. Below is what I picture the homepage to look like as well as one of the links. I am going to use red, black, and white for my colors as those are colors used for this issue. I am very passionate of this issue, I was actually a leader in a club in high school to raise money for rescue missions through the Internation Justice Mission. Thus, I have done research in this subject before.   </p>

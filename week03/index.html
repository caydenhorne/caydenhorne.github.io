	<h1>Week 3: As We May Think and Long Live the Web Response </h1>
	<h2> As We May Think by Vannevar Bush </h2>
	<p> When I first started reading this article, I was confused. I had forgotten that the article was written in 1945 
		and the internet had yet to exist for a couple centries and that information  as not as easily spread back then.
		I found it a little humorous when Bush notes that "Mendel's concept of the laws of 
		genetics was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the 
		few who were capable of grasping and extending it..." I guess I found this quote amusing because the idea 
		that such a significant and historical discovery could not attract much attention simply because information 
		was not easily spread. In addition, I have studied Mendel's experiments in science classes and I had assumed 
		that his discoveries must have been popular in his time. Furthermore, i found this reading interesting but a little hard for 
		me to fully grasp the concepts presented. However, I did find the memex concept interesting and I instantly compared it right away to 
		storing files on a computer. It is kind of crazy to think about how much Bush's world is a completely different world than what we live 
		in today.
